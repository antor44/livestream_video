# livestream_video.sh

Transcribe video livestream by feeding ffmpeg output to whisper.cpp at regular intervals, based in livestream.sh from whisper.cpp

This linux script adds some new features:

-Language command-line option: auto (for autodetection), en , es, fr, de, iw, ar, etc.  
-Traslate to english when auto is selected

Recomended linux video player: SMPlayer based in mvp, or any other video player based in mplaye, due to its capaccitites to timeshift online streams for sinchronice live v√≠deo with the trasncription. Most video stream should work.
